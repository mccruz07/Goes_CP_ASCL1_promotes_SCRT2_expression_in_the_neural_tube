Materials and Methods:  Cellular Distance Calculation from the Neural Tube Center in In Situ Hybridization (ISH) Images

This repository contains:
1. Cellpose model to segment the cells in ISH images of neural tubes
2. CellProfiler pipeline to segment the neuro tube, identify the center line and use the Cellpose model to identify the cells
3. Colab notebook to calculates and multiple plot the cells distances to a line (Neuro tube Center) Analysis in multiple images.
